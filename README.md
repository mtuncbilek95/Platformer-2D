# Platformer-2D W.I.P
It is a free 2D platformer game that gets all the sprites from https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/kings-and-pigs.

All the player scripts are made by using State Pattern(No Enums). So if you want to check the codes, be my guest. I hope you learn something from it.

You can watch a demo gameplay here:
