# Platformer-2D
It is a free 2D platformer game that gets all the sprites from https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/kings-and-pigs.
I called it Pigs Are In My Castle.

All the player scripts are made by using State Pattern(No Enums). So if you want to check the codes, be my guest. I hope you learn something from it. I tried to learn how to use State Pattern from the video series made by Bardent. You can find him on youtube. Also I will drop his tutorial down below.
